1. **NDVI - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index**

       NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

In Landsat 8-9, NDVI = (Band 5 – Band 4) / (Band 5 + Band 4)

2. **NDWI - Normalized Difference Water Index**

       NDWI = (Green – NIR)/(Green + NIR)

In Landsat 8-9, NDWI = (Band 3 - Band 5) / (Band 3 + Band 5)
